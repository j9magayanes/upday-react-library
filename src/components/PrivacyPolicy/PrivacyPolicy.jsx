            <p>
            <h4>3.Processed Data Categories</h4>

            As soon as you use upday, our system will automatically collect information from your computer system. The data which may be collected during this process is, among others:
            <ul>
                <li>Information on the browser type and version</li>
                <li>The operation system used</li>
                <li>Mobile device ID</li>
                <li>Date and time of access</li>
                <li>Web analytics data / pseudonym user profile (Cookie ID, Ad ID etc.)</li>
                <li>Websites that brought the user to our website</li>
                <li>Websites visited by the user from our website</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, we process the following personal data in case a contractual relationship between you and us exists, or when you have otherwise forwarded the data to us:
            <ul>
                <li>Login information with password</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>4. Legitimate Basis and Processing Purposes</h4>
            We process your data exclusively on the basis of one or more of the applicable legal regulations. Pursuant to GDPR, personal data can be processed on the basis of a contract or on the implementation of pre-contractual measures—subject to compliance—on the basis of legitimate interests or a law, and for the protection of essential or public interests. Registration is required in order for us to provide certain content or services on our website. Every user can register themselves for free at upday by specifying their first name, last name, email address, and a password, after which your registration data is sent to us. The collection and processing of this data is carried out in line with the licence agreement between us and the user, Art. 6, § 1 b GDPR. We’ll also use the email address we collected in the course of your registration or in the context of contract management, to inform you about similar products or services as well as previously existing subscriptions or general information on upday. In this case, email address processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests in requests for our products and services (Art. 6, § 1 f GDPR). In addition, we use your email address to send you our newsletter, if you’ve clearly indicated your agreement to receiving newsletter content or, as the case may be, publicity. To this effect we process your email address in order to send you the newsletter, as requested (Art. 6, § 1 f GDPR). You can always object, either in writing or per email, to the usage of your email address for such purposes taking effect in the future: 65, Axel-Springer-Str., Berlin, 10888,&nbsp;
            <u><a href="mailto:privacy@upday.com">privacy@upday.com</a></u>. No costs will be charged other than the transmission costs according to the base rate. On the Internet, every device needs to have a clear address for the transferral of data. This is called the IP address. Preliminary storage of the IP address is technically required in order to transfer the website to the computer of the user. In doing so, we abridge IP addresses before processing, thus, any later processing will take place anonymised. Any further storage or processing related to the unabridged IP addresses will not take effect. In addition, our servers save your IP address for 14 days for the purpose of your safety. During processing operations, which are determined by one or several of the previously mentioned legislative bases, processing will take place when it’s necessary for the purpose of preserving legitimate interests, unless these legitimate interests are overridden on the basis of a comprehensive weighing of your interests, and your fundamental rights and freedoms (Art. 6, § 1 f GDPR). A legitimate interest can be assumed when the person concerned is a customer of the controller. The processing of personal data and our legitimate interest therein and, in particular, the execution of our business operations, shall be in favour of the welfare of our employees and our shareholders. Our legitimate interest in offering you custom products, informing you on our products, improvements, and quality features, as well as continuing to improve our services and products, through which we’re also able to increase our sales, is the legal basis for the purpose of Big Data processing, online behavioural advertising, web/app analysis, and advertisement ranking (gathering different selection criteria for suitable advertising). For more detail on web analytics services see section 8. You can object to data processing on the basis of legitimate interests at any time (see section 12). In case the data is processed for any other purpose than as determined by data collection, a compatibility assessment will be carried out (see Art. 6, § 4 GDPR). Subsequent processing is only permitted if the original purpose is compatible with the new purpose, or when allowed by reason of a special legal basis. Recognised compatible purposes are, among others, enforcement, exercising or defence of claims subject to civil law, insofar as no overriding interest of the person concerned exists. We will inform you in case of a change in purpose. A new data collection will take place on the grounds of a new legal basis if the new purpose is incompatible with the purpose as determined by data collection. We will inform you on the change in purpose, should this be the case.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>5. Data Processing Location</h4>
            We will not transfer your personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) except when, in certain cases, it is permitted by the GDPR. Whether or not third parties with whom you have a contractual relationship (e.g. Facebook, if you have a Facebook account) transfer data to countries outside of the European Economic Area is not something we have any knowledge of, nor something we’re able to influence. We also process data in countries outside of the European Economic Area. To guarantee the protection of your personal rights, also in the context of these particular data transfers, we make sure to handle the contractual relationships with recipients in third party countries in compliance with the arrangement of standard contract clauses of the EU commission, corresponding to Art. 46 § 2 C, GDPR. These are available at all times via the following link:&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31995L0046">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:31995L0046</a></u>. Alternatively, you can request the documents using the contact information below. With the launch of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on 12/07/2016, the European Commission decided that, in view of these regulations, an appropriate level of personal data protection exists (adequacy decision, Art. 45, GDPR). Further information—also on certification of the service provider we deployed—you can find on&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov</a></u>. We only use US service providers who are certified according to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>6. Analysis Services</h4>
            In certain cases we also collect data because you provided your consent in the transferral of the data to us. As you will know, apps are provided for download on third party websites on a regular basis (such as iTunes, Google, etc.). When, according to the applicable terms of use, one of those upday GmbH &amp; Co. KG providers becomes your contractual partner for the acquisition of the app, we will process the data allocated to us by the third party provider, the volume of which will be determined by the contractual agreement, so that you can download the app to your mobile end device.

            <strong>References for the use of the apps</strong>&nbsp;Our app makes use of the following authorisations, with the purposes listed behind it, so that it can obtain access to certain features of your mobile end device: • Location – We require access to your location in order to display regional news. This feature is optional&nbsp;
            <strong>Facebook Connect</strong>&nbsp;You can login to upday via a Facebook account. Facebook Connect is offered by Facebook Ireland Limited, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland. The usage of Facebook Connect underlies the data protection stipulations and terms of use, as defined by Facebook. When you decide to register through your Facebook account, you will first be directed to Facebook. Once there, Facebook will ask you to login or to register with Facebook. The request to login will be skipped if you are already logged in to Facebook. Please note that we do not receive any login information during these steps. When registering through Facebook Connect, your Facebook profile data and the “public information” as defined by Facebook&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation">(https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation)</a></u>&nbsp;from your profile will be transferred to us. This regards data which you have made available to the public or which you have unblocked for the respective application. “Public” in the context of Facebook, means that anybody can see this data, also outside of Facebook. This includes your name, your profile and cover picture, your gender, networks, username (Facebook URL) and user identification number (Facebook ID). Vice versa, we may also transfer data to your Facebook profile. When you register with us through Facebook Connect, we will collect and process the data transferred to us for the purpose of your registration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>7. Transferring Your Data to Third Parties</h4>
            We only transfer your personal data to third parties when this transfer is required in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, and when this takes place with or in collaboration with another provider (e.g. in case of co-operations), when we are otherwise legally entitled or required to transfer your data, or when you have given us your consent. In order to provide our services, certain departments within our organisation can be informed of selected pieces of personal data. This includes employees working in bookkeeping, product management, marketing, and IT. In certain cases we also commission and deploy external service providers or connected companies in order to process data as instructed by us. We employ service providers for the purpose of processing. They are bound by strict contractual stipulations which are in compliance with the GDPR. They are not permitted to use your data for any other purposes. The processors provide the following services to us: registration service(s), content recommendation, hosting, customer service, survey and commentary service(s), maintenance and support service(s), and web/app analysis. The data transferral to processors takes place in accordance with Art. 28, § 1 GDPR, and alternatively on the basis of our legitimate interests in economic and technical gain with the deployment of specialised contractual processors, Art. 6 § 1 f GDPR. We will transfer data to public authorities provided that we’re obliged by law or when this is allowed for reasons of data protection, for instance the police or the department of public prosecution (Art. 6, § 1 c GDPR). This data transferral is for the purpose of our legitimate interests in fighting abuse, the prosecution of criminal offence, and the protection, enforcement, and execution of claims, as long as these are not overridden by your interest in, and fundamental right to, protection of your personal data, Art. 6 § 1 f GDPR.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>8. Web/App Analysis Services</h4>
            We deploy services which collect and interpret data for us from the website and the app in order to continuously improve and update our content in line with users’ interests, in addition to displaying behavioural online advertising. In case these service providers aren’t data controllers themselves, as defined by data protection regulations, they will always process the pseudonymised user data as bound by instructions based on a contractual processing agreement. You can deactivate future individual analysis services at any time. Below you can learn in more detail about the analysis services deployed by us:

            <strong>AppNexus</strong>&nbsp;We use AppNexus to help us display behavioural advertising. AppNexus is an advertising service provider and a mediation platform operator (AppNexus, 28 W. 23rd Street, New York, New York, 10010, USA). AppNexus collects and stores information about your activity, which enables the analysis of your user behaviour. These profiles are used to display advertising which specifically reflects your interests. Should you not want this, you may deactivate behavioural advertising here:&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy">https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy</a></u>.

            <strong>Google AdSense</strong>&nbsp;We integrated Google AdSense on this website. Google Adsense is an online service which enables us to advertise on third party websites. Google Adsense is based on algorithms that select advertisements displayed on third party websites which are suited to the respective websites’ content. Google AdSense allows interest-based targeting of the internet user, which is converted by generating individual user profiles. The operating company of Google AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. The goal of the Google AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website. Google AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. Through placing cookies, Alphabet Inc. is able to analyse our website usage. Each time one of the pages of our website into which a Google AdSense component is incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component, to transfer data to Alphabet Inc for the purpose of online advertising and to calculate the respective commission fees. In the context of this technical procedure, Alphabet Inc. acquires knowledge on personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which enables Alphabet Inc. to trace the origin and the clicks of the visitor, and subsequently calculate the according commission fees. The person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting internet browser settings. In addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Alphabet Inc. to place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned. Furthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Alphabet Inc. can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes. Google AdSense uses so-called web beacons. A web beacon is a miniature graphic image which is incorporated into a website to enable the creation of a log file record and a log file analysis, which in turn serves to conduct statistical analysis. Alphabet Inc. can, by means of the incorporated web beacon, record if and when a website has been accessed by a person concerned and which links the person concerned clicked on. Web beacons help to, among other things, determine the visitor flow of a website. Via Google AdSense, personal data and information including the IP address, which is necessary to select the displayed advertisement and determine the according commission fees, are transferred to Alphabet Inc. in the United States of America. The personal data are stored and processed in the United States of America. Under certain circumstances, Alphabet Inc. will transfer the personal data, which was collected by means of the described technical procedures, to third parties. Google AdSense is explained in more detail here:&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/de/adsense/start/">https://www.google.co.uk/intl/de/adsense/start/</a></u>.

            <strong>Google AdWords</strong>&nbsp;We integrated AdWords into this website. Google AdWords is an internet advertising service which allows advertisers to include ads in Google search engine results as well as in Google advertising networks. Google AdWords enables advertisers to determine certain keywords in advance, by means of which an ad in the Google search engine results will be shown in case the user’s search results are relevant in relation to these keywords. In the Google advertising network, ads are distributed across websites with relevant subjects by an automated algorithm and in consideration of the previously determined keywords. The operating company of Google AdWords is Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. The goal of Google Adwords is to publicise our website through placing interest-based advertising on the websites of third parties and in Google search engine results, in addition to placing third party ads on our website. Google will place a so-called Conversion Cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned, should the person concerned have accessed our website via a Google ad. A conversion cookie will lose its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned. By means of the conversion cookie, provided that the cookie is still valid, it will be determined if any subpages or, for example, the shopping basket of an online shop system on our website, have been accessed. The conversion cookie helps us, and Google, to determine if a person concerned that ended up on our website via an AdWords ad, has generated sales in terms of completing or cancelling the purchase of product(s). The data and information collected through the application of a conversion cookie is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website. These visitor statistics are in turn used by us, to determine the total number of users which were brought to us via AdWords ads. That is to say, to determine the success or the failure of the respective AdWords ads and to optimise our future AdWords ads. Neither our company nor any other Google AdWords clients receive information from Google which can be used to identify the person concerned. Personal information is stored by means of the conversion cookie, for instance the websites visited by the person concerned. Personal data, which includes the IP address and the internet connection used by the person concerned, is stored during each visit to our website and transferred to Google in the United States of America. Google in the United States of America stores this personal data. Under certain circumstances Google will transfer the personal data collected by means of the described technical procedures, to third parties. The person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings. In addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. Furthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google AdWords can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes. Furthermore, the person concerned can object to the interest-based advertising placed by Google. In order to do this, the person concerned must access the following page:&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://adssettings.google.co.uk/">https://adssettings.google.co.uk</a></u>&nbsp;, in each internet browser used and implement the desired adjustments. Please go to the following page for further information and to read about the data protection policies applied by Google:&nbsp;

            <strong>Google Analytics</strong>&nbsp;We have integrated Google Analytics (with the anonymisation feature) on this website. Google Analytics is a Web Analysis service. Web analysis is the collection, storing, and analysation of behavioural data of visitors to our website. A web analysation service determines, among other things, which website brought a person concerned to the current website (the so-called referrer), which subpages have been accessed on the website, or how often and for how long a subpage was visited. Web analysis is predominantly used to optimise a website and for a cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising. The operating company of Google Analytics Component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. We use the extension “_gat._anonymizeIp”, for web analysis via Google Analytics. With the use of this extension, Google abridges and anonymises the IP address of the person concerned´s internet connection when our website is accessed from a Member State of the European Union or another contractual state within the European Economic Area. The goal of the Google Analytics component is the analysis of the visitor flow on our website. Google uses the acquired data and information to evaluate the usage of our website, among other things, and to create online reports which illustrate the activity on our websites, and to fulfil other services connected to our website. Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned. Cookies have already been explained above. The placement of cookies allows Google to analyse the usage of our website. Each time one of the pages of our website, into which a Google Analytics component is incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component, to transfer data to Google for the purpose of online analysis. In the context of this technical procedure, Google acquires knowledge on personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, through which Google can trace the origin and the clicks of the visitor, and subsequently calculate the according commission fees. Cookies store personal data, for instance the time and the place of access, and the amount of visits to our website by the person concerned. For each visit to our website, the respective personal data, which includes the IP address and the internet connection used by the person concerned, is transferred to Google in the United States of America. Google in the United States of America stores this personal data. Under certain circumstances, Google will transfer the personal data collected through these technical procedures to third parties. The person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings. In addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned. Furthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google Analytics can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes. Furthermore, the person concerned has the option to dissent with and prohibit the collection and the processing of usage-based data in relation to this website by Google Analytics. In order to do this, the person concerned has to download and install a browser add-on via the following link&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></u>.

            <strong>Google DoubleClick</strong>&nbsp;We integrated components of Google DoubleClick into this website. DoubleClick is a brand of Google which predominantly markets special online marketing solutions to advertising agencies and publishing houses. The operating company of Google DoubleClick is Google Inc., Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA. Each time the website is accessed, and also for clicks and other activities, Google DoubleClick transfers data to the DoubleClick server. Each data transferral prompts a cookie request for the browser of the person concerned. When the browser accepts the request, DoubleClick will place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned. Cookies have already been explained above. The goal of cookies is to optimize and implement advertising. The cookie is used, among other things, to place and display advertisements as well as to create or improve advertising campaigns. In addition, the cookie helps to avoid multiple placements of the same advertising. DoubleClick uses a cookie ID, which is necessary to carry out technical procedures. The cookie ID is used, for instance, to display an advertisement in a browser. The cookie also helps DoubleClick to determine which advertisements have already been implemented into a browser, this in turn prevents repetition of the advertisement. Moreover, the cookie enables DoubleClick to create conversions. A conversion has taken place when a user clicks on a DoubleClick advertisement and subsequently, in the same browser, completes a purchase on the website of the advertiser. A DoubleClick cookie does not collect personal data. A DoubleClick cookie can, however, collect additional campaign identification. Campaign identification refers to the identification of a campaign with which the user has previously been connected. Each time one of the pages of our website into which a DoubleClick component has been incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective DoubleClick component, to transfer data to Google for the purpose of online advertising and to calculate the respective commission fees. By means of this technical procedure, Google acquires knowledge on data through which Google can calculate the according commission fees. Google can retrace, among other things, when the person concerned clicked on certain links on our website. The person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings. In addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned. Furthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.

It enables an analysis of your app usage. Generally, the generated user information is transferred to, and stored on, one of Google’s servers in the USA. In case IP anonymization is activated, Google will abridge and anonymise your IP address within EU member states and also within contractual states belonging to the European Economic Area. Only in rare cases will Google transfer the full IP address to the USA and abridge it there. Google will use this information to analyse your website(s) usage, to create reports on website activity, and to fulfil other services related to website and internet usage as agreed with the operating company.

            • User actions in relation to the app’s content cards (viewing, swiping, and clicks to open the card), in addition to the menu and the app settings (installed settings, etc.). • Information on the respective card (our internal card ID, the card category and its title). • App-related actions (opening the app, the app being moved to the background, app crashes). • Location of the end device during app usage (as precise as the city). This information is connected with the so-called “Unique Installation ID”, with which individual installations can be identified, this is integrated by Snowplow themselves. The data collected from your installations is used exclusively for one of the main features of the app, namely to continuously present you with content which corresponds better and more precisely to your personal interests during your use of the app. This is the only way for the app to truly become your personal news aggregator, which is also why the deployment of Snowplow for this purpose cannot be turned off. In addition, Snowplow may also be deployed for purposes which are tailored to suit a specific need, or for advertising or market research purposes, in alignment with § 15 section 3 Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetzes,TMG)).

If the person concerned clicks on any Facebook buttons implemented into our website, for instance the “Like” button, or when the person concerned places a comment, Facebook will attribute this information to the Facebook user account of the person concerned and save the personal data. Facebook will be notified by its components of the person concerned’s visit to our website, if the person concerned is logged into Facebook during the moment of access. This notification is independent of whether or not the person concerned has clicked on any of the Facebook components. The transferral to Facebook of this data and information can be prevented by the person concerned by logging out of their Facebook account prior to accessing our website. For more information on the collection, processing, and usage of personal data by Facebook, please go to the Facebook privacy policy which is publicly available on:&nbsp;

            <strong>Other Services</strong>

            Further services we deploy are:

            <strong>Getty Images</strong>&nbsp;We integrated components of the Getty Images company into this website. Getty Images is an American stock photo agency. A stock photo agency is a company which offers images and other image material. Generally, the merchandise of stock photo agencies consists of photographs, illustrations and film material. Various customers license their professional images on a stock photo agency, in particular website operators, editorial offices of print and TV media, and advertising agencies. The Getty Images component is operated by: Getty Images International, 1st Floor, The Herbert Building, The Park, Carrickmines, Dublin 18, Ireland. Getty Images allows the (potentially free) embedding of stock images. Embedding refers to the implementation or integration of certain third party content, for instance text, video or image data, which has been provided by an external website and subsequently appears on one’s own website. For this procedure, a so-called embed code is used. An embed-code is HMTL code which has been integrated by the website operator into a website. By default, if a website operator integrated an embed code, the external content of the other website will be displayed as soon as a website is visited. In order to display the third party content, the external content is loaded directly from the other website. Getty Images provides more information on content embedding here:&nbsp;
            <u><a href="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/resources/embed">https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/resources/embed</a></u>. Through the implementation of the embed code, which enables the display of Getty Images material, the IP address of internet connection via which the person concerned connects to our website is transferred to Getty Images. Getty Images collects the used browser type, the browser language, and the time and the duration of the access. Moreover, Getty Images can collect navigation information, this is information about the subpages which have been visited by the person concerned and clicked links, as well as other interactions carried out by the person concerned during their visit to our website.

In this case, your data will be marked with a restriction for future processing.

            <strong>Right to data portability</strong>&nbsp;You also have the right, insofar as applicable, to the transferral of your personal data to you or another responsible party in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, insofar as the processing is based on consent or on a contract, and the processing is carried out by automated means. However, this right does not apply in case the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition, you have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and insofar as the rights and freedoms of another person are not affected.

Furthermore, you have the right to object to the processing of personal data concerning you, which is taking place on the basis of a legitimate or public interest, on grounds relating to your particular situation. Including profiling based on these provisions. We will no longer process the personal data in case of an objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the person concerned or the processing is for the purpose of the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. In case we process personal data for direct marketing purposes, you will have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing by contacting the abovementioned address. This also includes profiling, to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. In addition, you have the right object to processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</strong>

The supervision authority with which the complaint has been lodged, shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of legal remedy.
